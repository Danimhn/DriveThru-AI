# DriveThru-AI
This is an AI system powered by natural language processing that's designed for drive-thrus to take food orders from customers through speech and even speak back to them.
You can find a demo [here](https://youtu.be/686kZuEHXKE).

In order to use the software you need to download the following Mozilla DeepSpeech models, and have them in the same directory as "SpeechToText" or change the paths in the modules:

* [pbmm](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.9.2/deepspeech-0.9.2-models.pbmm)

* [scorer](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.9.2/deepspeech-0.9.2-models.scorer)
